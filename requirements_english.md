# Semester Project “Robotics I” (2024-25)

## Course:
**"Robotics I: Analysis, Control, Laboratory"**  
(Academic Year 2024-25)

## Project: Industrial Robotic Manipulator  
**(KUKA Industrial Robot Manipulator)**

In **Figure 1** a six-revolute (6 DOF) industrial robotic manipulator is shown. The main mechanical parts, the axes, and the dimensions are illustrated in **Figure 2**, where the robot’s joints are numbered 1 through 6. The kinematic structure in the initial configuration is depicted in **Figure 3**, which also shows the reference frames of the base and the tool. The dimensions (lengths of links l0 through l7 in Figure 3) are also provided in **Table 1**.

## PART A. Theoretical Analysis

1. **Denavit-Hartenberg Method:**  
   Apply the Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) method to assign the coordinate frames for the links of the mechanism and determine the corresponding D-H parameters table.  
   _Note:_ For the remainder of the project, joints 4 through 6 are to be considered "inactive" (i.e., their angular displacements are fixed at zero: q4 = q5 = q6 = 0).

2. **Forward Kinematics:**  
   Derive the forward kinematic equations of the robotic mechanism.

3. **Jacobian Matrix:**  
   Determine the Jacobian matrix that describes the differential kinematic model for the given configuration of the robot.  
   _Note:_ For further analysis, you may assume that l3 = l6 = 0.

4. **Inverse Differential Kinematics:**  
   Analyze the inverse differential kinematic model of the mechanism in relation to the linear velocity of the end-effector OE, and identify the singular configurations.

5. **Inverse Geometric Kinematics:**  
   Derive the inverse geometric model of the robotic manipulator for a given position pE of its end-effector.

## PART B. Kinematic Simulation

Assume that the center of the robot’s end-effector OE is required, for a given robotic task, to perform a periodic linear displacement between two positions, PA (xA, yA, zA) and PB (xB, yB, zB), on a horizontal plane (with both zA and zB equal to h, a fixed distance from the robot base’s origin).

- It is assumed that at time t = 0 the end-effector is already at the initial position PA, and that the duration of the motion between PA and PB is T seconds.
- The trajectory should be smooth, meaning that it should be continuous in at least the velocity domain.

### Additional Tasks:
6. **Trajectory Design:**  
   Provide a detailed description of the design of the desired trajectory in the workspace.

7. **Kinematic Simulation and Visualization:**  
   Execute a kinematic simulation of the robotic mechanism and generate time plots for the following:
   - (a) **Desired Motion Profile:**  
     (1) The desired position of the end-effector (pEx, pEy, pEz) and  
     (2) The linear velocity of the end-effector at each time instance t.
   - (b) **Joint Parameters:**  
     The joint angles {q1, q2, q3} and the angular velocities {ẋq1, ẋq2, ẋq3} during the execution of the task.
   - (c) **Motion Diagram:**  
     At least one diagram that illustrates a sequence of intermediate configurations of the robotic kinematic chain (e.g., an animation of the motion).

### Remarks:
- Parameters that are not explicitly specified in PART B (such as the coordinates of PA and PB within the workspace, the period T, and the distance h) may be chosen according to the needs of the kinematic simulation.
